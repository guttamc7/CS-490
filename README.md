**Purpose**

There has been an every increasing trend on fitness and health in recent years. However, it has become extremely difficult to find the time and the motivation to workout regularly. Today, even with the multitude of fitness apps present, there is not a mobile platform that allows to connect with fellow fitness enthusiasts. Many students and faculty on various campuses own a smart-phone that they always carry on them. With the introduction of this application college students and professors around the country can now live a fitter life.

###For running project###

- For kindle, please have developer options ticked inside settings. It can happen that you connect the kindle to your laptop and Android Studio cannot detect it even though the kindle is getting charged. This means that the kindle's wire is defected and you can get it changed.
- The application can be run with an emulator, this can be done by editing run confugurations for the application and selection the reqiured emulatior. This emulator in Android Studio is a lot faster and better then Eclipse.
