**Purpose**

There has been an every increasing trend on fitness and health in recent years. However, it has become extremely difficult to find the time and the motivation to workout regularly. Today, even with the multitude of fitness apps present, there is not a mobile platform that allows to connect with fellow fitness enthusiasts. Many students and faculty on various campuses own a smart-phone that they always carry on them. With the introduction of this application college students and professors around the country can now live a fitter life.
